Auto evaluation of students assignment by using python flask frame work for real time Web application.


ANSWER:
Here's a high-level overview of how you can create an auto-evaluation system for students' assignments using Python Flask framework for a real-time web application:

System Requirements

- Python 3.8+
- Flask 2.0+
- Flask-SQLAlchemy for database management
- Flask-Login for user authentication
- Flask-WTF for form handling
- Python libraries for specific assignment types (e.g., ast for Python code analysis)

System Design

1. Database Design:
    - Create a database schema using Flask-SQLAlchemy to store assignments, students, and evaluation results.
    - Define models for Assignment, Student, and EvaluationResult.
2. Assignment Submission:
    - Create a Flask route for students to submit their assignments.
    - Use Flask-WTF to handle form data and validate submissions.
    - Store the submitted assignment in the database.
3. Auto-Evaluation:
    - Create a Flask route for auto-evaluation of submitted assignments.
    - Use Python libraries specific to the assignment type (e.g., ast for Python code analysis) to evaluate the submission.
    - Store the evaluation result in the database.
4. Real-time Feedback:
    - Use Flask-SocketIO to establish real-time communication between the client and server.
    - Send the evaluation result to the client as soon as it's available.
5. User Authentication:
    - Use Flask-Login to handle user authentication.
    - Require students to log in before submitting assignments.


1. Create a Flask app with a MongoDB database.
2. Design a form for students to submit assignments.
3. Evaluate the submitted code using a library like ast.
4. Store the evaluation results in the database.
5. Display the results in real-time using JavaScript and AJAX.

Example Code

from flask import Flask, request, jsonify
from flask_pymongo import PyMongo

app = Flask(__name__)
app.config["MONGO_URI"] = "mongodb://localhost:27017/assignment_db"
mongo = PyMongo(app)

@app.route('/submit_assignment', methods=['POST'])
def submit_assignment():
    
    return jsonify({'result': 'Correct'})

This simplified version focuses on the core idea of creating an auto-evaluation system using Flask and MongoDB.
