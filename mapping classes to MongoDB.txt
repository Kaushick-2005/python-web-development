mapping classes to MongoDB

ANSWER:

In Python, you can map classes to MongoDB using the MongoEngine library. Here's an example:

Step 1: Install MongoEngine

pip install mongoengine

Step 2: Define your MongoDB connection

from mongoengine import connect

connect('mydatabase', host='localhost', port=27017)

Step 3: Define your class

from mongoengine import Document, StringField, IntField

class User(Document):
    name = StringField(required=True)
    email = StringField(required=True, unique=True)
    age = IntField(required=True)

In this example, we define a User class that inherits from Document. We define three fields: name, email, and age, each with its own data type and constraints.

Step 4: Create a new document

user = User(name='John Doe', email='john@example.com', age=30)
user.save()

This code creates a new User document and saves it to the MongoDB database.

Step 5: Query the database

users = User.objects()
for user in users:
    print(user.name, user.email, user.age)

This code queries the MongoDB database for all User documents and prints their names, emails, and ages.

That's it! With MongoEngine, you can easily map Python classes to MongoDB documents and perform CRUD (create, read, update, delete) operations on them.
