git merge and git rebase.

ANSWER:

Here's a detailed explanation of git merge and git rebase:

Git Merge

git merge is a command used to integrate changes from one branch into another. It creates a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the merge process:

1. Checkout the target branch: Switch to the branch where you want to integrate the changes. For example, git checkout master.
2. Merge the source branch: Run git merge <source-branch-name>. For example, git merge feature/new-feature.
3. Resolve conflicts (if any): If there are conflicts between the two branches, Git will pause the merge process. You'll need to resolve the conflicts manually and then commit the changes.
4. Create a merge commit: Once the conflicts are resolved, Git will create a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches.

Types of Merges

There are two types of merges:

1. Fast-forward merge: If the target branch is a direct descendant of the source branch, Git will perform a fast-forward merge. This type of merge simply moves the target branch pointer to the latest commit of the source branch.
2. True merge: If the target branch is not a direct descendant of the source branch, Git will perform a true merge. This type of merge creates a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches.

Merge Strategies

Git provides several merge strategies that can be used to customize the merge process. Some common merge strategies include:

1. Recursive strategy
2. Resolve strategy
3. Octopus strategy

Merge Example

Suppose we have two branches, master and feature/new-feature. The master branch has the following commits:

A -> B -> C

The feature/new-feature branch has the following commits:

A -> D -> E

This will create a new merge commit that combines the changes from both branches. The resulting commit history will look like this:

A -> B -> C -> F

where F is the new merge commit.


Git Rebase

git rebase is a command used to reapply commits from one branch onto another. It's an alternative to merging, and it can be used to maintain a linear commit history.

Here's a step-by-step explanation of the rebase process:

1. Checkout the source branch: Switch to the branch that contains the commits you want to rebase. For example, git checkout feature/new-feature.
2. Rebase the commits: Run git rebase <target-branch-name>. For example, git rebase master.
3. Resolve conflicts (if any): If there are conflicts between the two branches, Git will pause the rebase process. You'll need to resolve the conflicts manually and then continue the rebase process.
4. Reapply the commits: Once the conflicts are resolved, Git will reapply the commits from the source branch onto the target branch.

Types of Rebases

There are two types of rebases:

1. Rebase with merge: This type of rebase uses the merge strategy to reapply commits. It's the default rebase strategy used by Git.
2. Rebase with interactive: This type of rebase uses an interactive shell to reapply commits. It allows you to edit the commit history and squash or reorder commits.

Rebase Example

Suppose we have two branches, master and feature/new-feature. The master branch has the following commits:

A -> B -> C

The feature/new-feature branch has the following commits:

A -> D -> E

This will reapply the commits from the feature/new-feature branch onto the master branch. The resulting commit history will look like this:

A -> B -> C -> D' -> E'

where D' and E' are the rebased commits.
